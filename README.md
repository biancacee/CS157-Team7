# CS157-Team7

For this project the team has decided to implement a relational database management system that provides students with a website of the student clubs offered at San Jose State University. Currently there is not a single platform to review and rate clubs at the University. The goal of this website is to allow students to search for a specific club at the university, and review the comments left by other students in order to decide if the club meets their expectations. Students will also be able to interact with their peers by commenting on each otherâ€™s reviews. The platform will contain student clubs from different majors and make it easy for students to browse the options provided on campus. In addition students will be able to rate the clubs using a 5 star rating system. The website will give students a single platform to find contact information, location, and other details that are needed to make a final decision on which student club suits their educational goals. Clubs are able to monitor their webpage and add information that will encourage students to join. Student feedback can be used to make improvements or changes that can attract new members. The stakeholders would include students, and most importantly the university club leads as they will be the ones willing to operate and use the platform.
