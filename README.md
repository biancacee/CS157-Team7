# CS157-Team7

The project aims to create a website for San Jose State University students, implementing a relational database management system. The website will serve as a centralized platform for students to explore and review various student clubs on campus. The goal is to enable students to search for specific clubs, read reviews from other students, and interact by leaving comments. The platform will encompass clubs from different majors, allowing easy browsing for students. A 5-star rating system will be in place for students to evaluate clubs. The website will provide essential details such as contact information and location, helping students make informed decisions about joining a club. Clubs can manage their webpages, utilizing student feedback to make improvements and attract new members. The primary stakeholders are students and university club leads who will operate and benefit from the platform.
